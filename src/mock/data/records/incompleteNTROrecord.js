Set at a fundraiser for Joh in 1987, audiences will want to sing along to original tunes such as <em>Pumpkin Scone Diplomacy</em>, <em>Feeding the Chooks</em> and the most catchy political song ever, <em>Joh for PM</em>.<br /><br />Bjelke-Petersen was Queensland&rsquo;s longest serving, longest-lived, and most quotable Premier. He was one of the best-known and most controversial political figures of 20th century Australia. Award-winning playwright Stephen Carleton (<em>The Narcissist</em>, <em>The Turquoise Elephant</em>, <em>Bastard Territory</em>) and Off-Broadway composer Paul Hodge (<em>Clinton: The Musical</em>) have taken inspiration from these historic events to create one of the best musicals to come out of Queensland.",

        "<p><em>Joh for PM</em>&nbsp;is a new Australian full-length musical theatre production that was commissioned by JUTE Theatre Company and Playlab. I was initially commissioned to undertake the historical/political research about Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#39;s life from childhood through to his aborted tilt at the Australian Prime Ministership in 1987; and to write the first draft of the book and song lyrics. Brisbane Powerhouse was then attached to the project as co-producer, and brought Paul Hodge in to compose music and redraft songs and write new ones. We worked together on the project through to the culmination of a professional development process in December 2016 at the Powerhouse. The Queensland Music Festival were invited to the public reading at the end of that week, and chose the piece to open the 2017 festival at the Brisbane Powerhouse&#39;s main auditorium, with a tour to Cairns following closely thereafter. Kris Stewart, the AD of Brisbane Powerhouse directed, and national musical and comedy stars Colin Lane (Lano and Woodley) and Chloe Dallimore (The Producers) starred.</p><p>While there have been many political plays, cabarets, stand up comedy shows (<em>The Gillies Report</em>), memoirs, PhD theses, documentaries and non-fiction books&nbsp;dealing with the controversial premier and the long shadow he has cast over Queensland cultural and political life, this is the first full scale professional musical dealing with the biography of BJP. It is also Brisbane Powerhouse and JUTE Theatre Company&#39;s first commissioned musicals built &#39;from scratch&#39;. It received widely disseminated national media coverage and reviews, including interviews with Radio National, ABC radio and TV, and a host of local broadcasters and print media outlets. Much of the critical review focussed on the piece&#39;s contemporary resonance and the timeliness of portraying (albeit via musical comedy) a populist politician with autocratic disposition in the era of Trump, Brexit, Hanson et al. Plans are afoot for a 2020 remount and tour.</p>",
