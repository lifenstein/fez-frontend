This component supplies the Admin page NTRO panel with the ability to view and edit:

- the Scale of Significance (select dropdown) and, 
- the Creator Contribution Statement (text field) 
 
for works which are Creative

Scale of Significance tells us whether the author's contribution to the work is Major or Minor.

The Contribution Statement describes the contribution that author made to the work.
